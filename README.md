Repeatedly runs nethack until you have a wizard with the identify spell and a ring of slow digestion.

You need to set your .nethackrc so that your charater is created with name, class, alignment and gender automatically.  This
script could be altered to supply those, but I just set my .nethackrc  An example nethackrc file is provided.  You will want
to change the wizard's name and the cat's name.
